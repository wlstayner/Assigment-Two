  <P>Nassau County is known for its beaches, but the eastern part of Long Island isn’t always a relaxing environment for everyone.</P>
  <P>A CUNY News Service data analysis found Nassau ranks at the top of New York counties when it comes to a form of discriminatory prison sentencing.</P>
  <aside class="pquote">
        <blockquote>
            <p>"12 percent of Nassau County’s population is Black, but 60 percent of its prison sentences were allocated to Black people."</p>
        </blockquote>
  </aside>
  <P>Out of all 62 New York counties, Nassau County has the largest gap between a county’s Black population and the percent of total prison sentences given to Black people in the county.</P>
  <P>According to 2019 data from the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services, 12 percent of Nassau County’s population is Black, but 60 percent of its prison sentences were allocated to Black people.</P>
  <P>That kind of gap is common in New York, where 58 out of 62 counties have a smaller Black population than the county’s percent of Black prison sentences.
  Thirteen New York Counties have a 40 percent or larger gap between county Black population and percent of Black prison sentences, while 17 counties have a 30 percent or larger gap. Overall, 58 out of 62 counties, have this form of gap.</P>
  <P>Newsday, a daily newspaper in Long Island, investigated discriminatory policing practices in Nassau and Suffolk counties in 2017. The newspaper found that police in both counties made most of their arrests for smaller charges such as resisting arrest, obstruction of governmental administration, criminal trespass and drug-related offenses.</P>
  <P>Much of those arrests came from patrolling “hotspots” for crime, Newsday reported, or came because of pull-over traffic stops.</P>
  <P>The newspaper referred to this as the suburban equivalent to New York City’s stop-and frisk tactics, where NYPD officers stopped, questioned and patted down people on the street. A judge ruled that stop-and-frisk was being used in an unconstitutional manner in 2013.</P>
  <P>An overreliance on this type of policing leads to racially disproportionate outcomes in arrests, according to the newspaper.</P>
