**Proposed headline:** Black people disproportionately represent prison sentences in 59 of New York's 62 counties
**Questions I want to answer:** I want to see what counties have the biggest margin between Black population and prison sentences of Black people. The disparity in 2019 for NY (15 percent of pop vs 48 percent of sentences) and NYC are large (22 vs 55).
**Hypotheses:** I think there will be some counties with small disparities, but overall I think most counties will have a pretty massive gap between population and prison sentences. Albany County (12 % of pop vs 59 % of prison sentences) and Chemung County (7 vs. 49) were two that stood out on an initial once-over. There's only three counties that don't have this overrepresentation. 
**Info about data:** This data comes from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. It's the 2019 adult arrests and sentences by race/ethnicity. It tracks that data for the entire state, NYC and every county.
